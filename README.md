# Understanding Focus

Lets start from basics. 

## Thin-Lens Equation
The Thin-Lens Equation is a fundamental principle in optics that describes the relationship between the focal length of a lens, the distance from the lens to the object being focused on, and the distance from the lens to the image formed by that object. It applies to lenses that are thin enough that their thickness can be neglected in calculations, a common approximation in many practical situations.

The formula for the **Thin-Lens Equation** is:

Where:

- ùëì is the focal length of the lens,
- ùëëùëú is the distance from the lens to the object,
- ùëëùëñ is the distance from the lens to the image.
  
This equation helps predict how a particular lens will project light and how it will affect the size and position of the image formed.

## Circle of Confusion
The Circle of Confusion (CoC) refers to the optical spot created by a cone of light from a lens that is not perfectly focused. In simpler terms, it is the degree to which a point light source appears as a blurred, disc-like shape in an image, which affects image sharpness. CoC is a critical concept in understanding optical imaging, particularly in photography and cinematography. It represents the maximum blur spot that is indistinguishable from a point to the human eye or is considered acceptably sharp in an image. CoC is influenced by sensor size, viewing conditions, and print size.

The Circle of Confusion can be calculated based on sensor size and desired print resolution. A commonly used formula to estimate CoC is:

Where:

- ùëë is the diagonal of the sensor in millimeters.
- 1730 is a constant that comes from typical viewing conditions and visual acuity assumptions (Print Size / Image Size)  (this constant can vary depending on the source, with some using 1500 to 2000 based on more critical sharpness criteria).

## Hyperfocal Distance
Hyperfocal distance is the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp; focusing at this distance maximizes the depth of field from half this distance to infinity.

**Hyperfocal Distance Formula** ùêª can be calculated using the formula:

Where:

- ùëì is the focal length of the lens,
- ùëÅ is the aperture number (f-stop),
- ùëê is the Circle of Confusion.


## Limits of acceptable sharpness
### Near Focus and Far Focus Distance Limits
The near focus and far focus distance limits define the boundaries within which all objects are rendered acceptably sharp in an image.

**Near Focus Distance Limit**  ùê∑ùëõ  can be determined by:

![image](https://github.com/akaraoglu/focus_bracketing/assets/32932292/21a93472-e703-4029-9a75-c0374c6bb2e6)

Where:

- ùë† is the focus distance,
- ùêª is the hyperfocal distance,
- ùëì is the focal length.

**Far Focus Distance Limit** ùê∑ùëì is calculated as:

![image](https://github.com/akaraoglu/focus_bracketing/assets/32932292/b1c13259-416a-493c-ae78-d8774e33b60a)

If  ùë† is greater than ùêª, then ùê∑ùëì is infinity.

By focusing on the hyperfocal distance, photographers can achieve the deepest possible depth of field for a given aperture and focal length. The near and far focus limits are particularly useful for landscape photographers who need to ensure maximum sharpness from the foreground to the horizon. Understanding and calculating these distances allows photographers to pre-plan their shots for optimal sharpness across the entire image.

## Depth of Field Explained
Depth of Field (DoF) is the range within a photo that appears acceptably sharp. It is influenced by the lens aperture, the focal length, the focus distance, and the size of the Circle of Confusion. The formula for calculating DoF is given by:

![image](https://github.com/akaraoglu/focus_bracketing/assets/32932292/d3ee598a-05c0-4b60-af48-79bea7d68633)

Where:

- ùë¢ is the distance to the subject,
- ùëÅ is the aperture number,
- ùëê is the Circle of Confusion,
- ùëì is the focal length.
 
The "+/-" in the formula accounts for the DoF extending beyond and in front of the subject.

## Focus Bracketing 
Focus bracketing is an advanced photography technique used to extend the depth of field in images. It involves taking several photographs of the same scene at different focus distances and combining them to create a single image with greater sharpness throughout. To fully understand focus bracketing, we must first grasp the concept of the Circle of Confusion (CoC).

In focus bracketing, a photographer takes multiple shots of the same scene, adjusting the focus point slightly between each shot. This technique is particularly useful in macro photography where DoF is extremely shallow, even at small aperture settings.

The process involves determining the nearest and farthest points in the scene that need to be in focus. By using the DoF formula, one can calculate the necessary number of shots and the focus adjustment needed between each shot to ensure every part of the scene is sharp.


## Conclusion
Focus bracketing is a powerful technique that requires an understanding of both the Circle of Confusion and Depth of Field. By mastering these concepts and applying the correct formulas, photographers can create images with unprecedented depth and sharpness. This method is particularly useful in situations where traditional photography might fail to capture the complexity of a scene in sharp detail.

# Circle of Confusion (CoC) Detailed in Digital Imaging
## What is Circle of Confusion?
In photography and optics, the Circle of Confusion (CoC) refers to the size of a blurred spot which results when a point source of light is not perfectly focused on a sensor or film plane. In the context of digital imaging, it's particularly significant because it helps define the limits of depth of field and overall image sharpness.

## CoC and Pixel Limitation
In digital cameras, the sensor is composed of pixels, which are the smallest units of an image capable of capturing light. The idea that one pixel can be the limit for the CoC comes from a desire for maximum resolution and sharpness; ideally, each point of light would map perfectly to a single pixel. However, if the CoC is smaller than a single pixel, the camera's resolving power is not fully utilized‚Äîthe image can appear overly sharp or unnaturally detailed.

Conversely, if the CoC is larger than a single pixel, the resulting image starts losing detail and appears blurry because the blur circle spreads across multiple pixels, blending light and color information. This loss of detail usually manifests as a lack of clarity and contrast, especially noticeable in areas of fine texture or at the edges between different objects.

## Impact of Demosaicing on CoC
Demosaicing is a process used to reconstruct a full-color image from the incomplete color samples output by an image sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). Most digital cameras use a Bayer filter matrix to capture color data, which only records one primary color per pixel. Demosaicing algorithms work to interpolate the two colors not captured at each pixel, predicting them from neighboring pixels.

The process of demosaicing has a direct impact on the perceived CoC because it introduces a level of softness or blur to the image. This is due to the interpolation needed to estimate missing color information, which can slightly enlarge the effective CoC. If CoC calculations do not consider the softening effects of demosaicing, the image may end up appearing less sharp than intended.

## Why CoC is Usually Tuned to 2 Pixels
The industry standard of tuning the Circle of Confusion to around 2 pixels is based on a balance between achievable detail and the inherent limitations of digital sensors and lens optics. By setting the CoC to approximately 2 pixels:

- **Resolution Optimization:** It ensures that the sensor resolves detail up to its practical limit without introducing unnecessary artifacts from trying to over-resolve beyond the sensor's capability or the resolving power of the lens.
- **Perceptual Sharpness:** This setting helps maintain a visually pleasing level of sharpness that aligns with human perception. Images are sharp enough to appear detailed without the harshness that can come from smaller CoC values.
- **Practicality in Lens Design:** Lenses are designed considering these standard CoC values, balancing sharpness, aberrations, and cost.

**In conclusion**, the choice of a CoC of around 2 pixels is a pragmatic decision that helps maximize both the technical and perceptual qualities of digital images. It accommodates the limitations and capabilities of current digital imaging technology while providing a good compromise between sharpness and natural-looking images.

**Hyperfocal distance:** The closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp. When the lens is focused at this distance, all objects at distances from half of the hyperfocal distance out to infinity will be acceptably sharp.
**Hyperfocal near limit:** The distance between the camera and the first element that is considered to be acceptably sharp when focusing at the hyperfocal distance. 
**Depth of field (DOF):** The distance between the farthest and nearest points which are in acceptable focus. This can also be identified as the zone of acceptable sharpness in front of and behind the subject to which the lens is focused on. 
**DOF near limit:** The distance between the camera and the first element that is considered to be acceptably sharp.
**DOF far limit:** The distance between the camera and the furthest element that is considered to be acceptably sharp.
**Depth of Field (DOF) In Front:** Distance between the DoF Near Limit and the focus plane.
**Depth of Field (DOF) Behind:** Distance between the focus plane and the DoF Far Limit.
